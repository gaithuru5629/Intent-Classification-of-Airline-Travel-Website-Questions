# Intent-Classification-of-Airline-Travel-Website-Questions

## Identifying customer intent based on past queries or enquiries

Since every customer has purposeful interactions with an organization, which might be to unsubscribe/
subscribe to emails or newsletters, make purchases, request for a downgrade or upgrade,
book a flight, cancel or postpone a flight etc., it is imperative that these intentions are quickly identified
so that businesses can pre-empt the needs of customers. This assignment focuses on the use of
machine learning and natural language processing to automatically analyze customer reviews on an
airline website in order to determine customers’ intentions. These intentions are then classified as
either queries on flight times, flights in general, airfare, cancellations and so on, so as to efficiently
serve customers and improve their experience on the airline’s website.

The steps that were taken in this assignment are

1. Dataset identification and loading     
2. Exploratory data analysis.     
3. Text and label definition     
4. Data split into training and testing sets.     
5. Data preprocessing by tokenizing.     
6. Data padding to make all phrases the same length.     
7. Converting the labels into one-hot encoding.     
8. Applying Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) to enhance learning     
9. Model training and evaluation.     
10. Accuracy measurement and conclusion.
